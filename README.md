# Stellaria-Advanced-Launcher

## (Method 1) To run .py file
To run the app with .py file you need to download Python and the required libraries. This can be done either manually or automatically.

#### Automatically
If you choose to do it automatically, simply download the start.bat file and put it into your Stellaria folder, then run it as an admin. I recommend creating a shortcut to the start.bat file, and configuring the shortcut to always run as an administrator. You can also assign it the Stellaria icon from start.exe / .Stellaria-launcher.exe for a cleaner look.

#### Manually
If you choose to do it manually, then download python from the official website. While installing the Python, make sure to check the option to add python to PATH. Then open a cmd / powershell and pip install all the dependencies found in the file requirements.txt. And finally, download the main.py file, put it into your stellaria folder and open it with python.

## (Method 2) To run .exe file
Download the Stellaria Advanced Launcher.exe file and put it into your stellaria folder, then run it.
