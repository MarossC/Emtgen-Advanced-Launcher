# Stellaria-Advanced-Launcher

## (Method 1) To run .py file
To run the app, you need to download Python and the required libraries. This can be done manually or automatically by running the start.bat file.

Once you have installed all the dependencies, simply move the main.py file into your Stellaria folder. Then, run it using your preferred method (IDE, command prompt), or move the start.bat file into the Stellaria folder and run it as an administrator.

I recommend placing the start.bat file in your Stellaria folder and then creating a shortcut to the start.bat file. Configure the shortcut to always run as an administrator and assign it the Stellaria icon from start.exe.

## (Method 2) To run .exe file
Put the .exe file into your stellaria folder and run it
