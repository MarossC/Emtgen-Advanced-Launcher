# Stellaria-Advanced-Launcher

## To run .py file
In order for the app to run, you need to download python and the required libraries. This can either be done manually, or automatically by running the start.bat file.

Once you have all the dependencies installed, simply move the main.py file into your stellaria folder, and either run it with your favourite method (IDE, cmd) or also move the file start.bat into the stellaria folder and run it as an admin. 

I recommend placing the start.bat file into your stellaria folder and then creating a shortcut to the start.bat file, which you then configure to always start as an admin and you also can give it the stellaria icon from start.exe

## To run .exe
Put the .exe file into your stellaria folder and run it
